A Firefox extension to display Telegram within the Firefox sidebar. This extension adds a new section to the sidebar which contains the Telegram web app. It also adds a shortcut, and a button toggle within the toolbar.

[![Get the Addon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semanticdata/text-revealer-firefox-extension/master/firefox.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/telegram-in-sidebar/)

## Usage

1. Toggle the sidebar by pressing _`Alt+Shift+T`_. This shortcut can be changed by going to _`Add-ons` → `Telegram in Sidebar` → `Options`_.
2. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the sidebar.

## How to Unlock Firefox Sidebar Width

The sidebar's width is _locked by default_ in Firefox. Unfortunately, the sidebar is very restrictive and I can only do so much to enhance the functionality of this extension. I put together a step-by-step guide on how to unlock it.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. In a new tab, navigate to `about:support`.
2. Under _Application Basics_, find _Profile Folder_.
3. Locate and click the `Open Folder` button next to it. It will be next to an address similar to: `%appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\{profile-id}.default`.
4. Inside your Firefox _Profile Folder_, create a new folder named: `chrome`.
5. Inside the newly created chrome folder, create a new file named: `userChrome.css`.
6. Copy the following code, paste as content and save:

```css
#sidebar-box {
  max-width: 40% !important;
  min-width: 300px !important;
}
```

7. Finally, in a new tab, navigate to `about:config` and search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and change it to `true`.
8. Restart Firefox and test it out!
