## Description

<b>Introduction</b>
This Firefox Extension displays the Telegram within the Firefox sidebar. It adds a new section to the sidebar which contains the Telegram web app. It also provides a shortcut, and toggle button.

<b>How to Use</b>
Toggle the sidebar by pressing <b>Alt+Shift+T</b>.
This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Telegram in Sidebar -> Options. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the sidebar.

<b>How to Unlock Firefox Sidebar Width</b>
The sidebar's width is <i>locked by default</i> in Firefox. Unfortunately, the sidebar is very restricted and I can only do so much to enhance the functionality of this extension. I put together a step-by-step guide on how to unlock the sidebar width on my <a href="https://miguelpimentel.do/unlock-firefox-sidebar/">Blog</a>.

<b>Disclaimer</b>
This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to Telegram in any way. This extension is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. This add-on <i>only</i> launches their web app in the sidebar.
